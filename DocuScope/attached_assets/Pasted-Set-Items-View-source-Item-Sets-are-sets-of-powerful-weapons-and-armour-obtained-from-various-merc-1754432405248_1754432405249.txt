Set Items
View source
Item Sets are sets of powerful weapons and armour obtained from various merchants, quests and mobs throughout the map. They provide a 'set bonus' when multiple pieces from the set are worn. After the Gavel Expansion, most Set armours are no longer sold, and can be obtained in areas near the Merchant (For example, the Leaf Set is dropped from mobs in the Nivla Woods)

These are not all the sets to exist, and more are still being added. Do not take this page for the complete list.
